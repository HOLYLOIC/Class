//All of coding is with the need of correct spelling and capitalization so even if you spell Scanner as scanner when needed it won't work
//Decloration - Datatype + name of varible. Ex. Int x
//Datatype - the data that is in the language by default like int(whole number) and bool(boolian namded after the man who made it they are true or false statments)
//class and objects - Things that need to be imported using code like using scanners. Ex Import java.util.Scanner
//initilisization (I can't spell) - First time you assign an a value(number) to a varible(x or y or whatever you want)
//Overwrite - when you replace code with code. Ex int x = 4; then later typing int x = 5; it will take which ever state(line or where you are in the code takes place after the semicolon ;)
//order of operations - ....pemdas from algebra
//incriments - just +1 or -1 writen by ++1 or --1
//state - where the code is or what the code is = to
//sum - varible x + y
//numeric operations - a table of state, x, and y however a value is only added or changed based off state 
//caste - change from one data type to another normally used with doubles and int
//literal - the literal number 
// - makes it to where java can't read or just ignores it 
//siple operations +/-///*/%
//advance operations +=/-=/ you get it

All read from right to left

x = x + y                      <---- x += y same at that

    add these to then solve
